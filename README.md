## Description

This application is a Progressive Web Application that aides a user in maintaining a stable budget. The application works both with online and offline capabilities. The user can use the application under normal online conditions. When the use loses network connectivity, the application will still function and will then update the database once an online connection has been re-established.

## Application

-Run application from heroku

## Usage

The user can use the application by simply navigating to the heroku link. From there the user is presented with the default index page. They can start tracking their budget but adding or subtracting integer values as needed. When the user loses internet connection, the app should theoretically still save any input from the user. Any values inputted while offline will be updated to the database once the internet connection has been established.
